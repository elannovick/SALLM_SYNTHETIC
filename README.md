# SALLM_SYNTHETIC
Synthetic data creation

This is divided into 3 sections:
1.) Synthetic data via story prompting.
2.) Syntetic data via story translation.
3.) Synthetic data via code comment translation.

The below outlines how each of these is done.

1.)Synthetic data via story prompting.
The synthetic data via story prompting was done for both isiZulu and isiXhosa. The code provided is for isiXhosa and uses the Afrollama model which can be found here https://huggingface.co/Jacaranda/AfroLlama_V1.  For the purposes of this project, I used a 4-bit quantization for faster inference.
